Name of Project: Snake Game

Description: For this project we have decided to work on a simple snake game. Our focus is to build a simple game using
pygame which is a python module to design our project. At the end, we aim to have a simple user interphase game that
will be just fun to play. The main purpose of the game is to allow individuals to escape the problems of reality and have fun while playing the game
playing games like this can help manage mental health which will allow an individual to be mentally stable.
